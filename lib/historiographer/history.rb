# See Historiographer for more details
#
# Historiographer::History is a mixin that is
# automatically included in any History class (e.g. RetailerProductHistory).
#
# A History record represents a snapshot of a primary record at a particular point
# in time.
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# E.g. You have a RetailerProduct (ID: 1) that makes the following changes:
#
# 1) rp = RetailerProduct.create(name: "Sabra")
#
# 2) rp.update(name: "Sabra Hummus")
#
# 3) rp.update(name: "Sabra Pine Nut Hummus")
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# Your RetailerProduct record looks like this:
#
# <#RetailerProduct:0x007fbf00c78f00 name: "Sabra Pine Nut Hummus">
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# But your RetailerProductHistories look like this:
#
# rp.histories
#
# <#RetailerProductHistory:0x007fbf00c78f01 name: "Sabra", history_started_at: 1.minute.ago, history_ended_at: 30.seconds.ago>
# <#RetailerProductHistory:0x007fbf00c78f02 name: "Sabra Hummus", history_started_at: 30.seconds.ago, history_ended_at: 10.seconds.ago>
# <#RetailerProductHistory:0x007fbf00c78f03 name: "Sabra Pine Nut Hummus", history_started_at: 10.seconds.ago, history_ended_at: nil>
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# Since these Histories are intended to represent a snapshot in time, they should never be
# deleted or modified directly. Historiographer will manage all of the nuances for you.
#
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
#
# Your classes should be written like this:
#
# class RetailerProduct < ActiveRecord::Base
#   include Historiographer
# end
#
# # This class is created automatically. You don't
# # need to create a file yourself, unless you
# # want to add additional methods.
# #
# class RetailerProductHistory < ActiveRecord::Base
#   include Historiographer::History
# end
#

      # the most recent history.
      #
      scope :current, -> { where(history_ended_at: nil).order(id: :desc) }

      #
      # A History class will be linked to the user
      # that made the changes.
      #
      # E.g.
      #
      # RetailerProductHistory.first.user
      #
      # To use histories, a user class must be defined.
      #

      # 
      # Historiographer is opinionated about how History classes
      # should be named.
      #
      # For a class named "RetailerProductHistory", the History class should be named
      # "RetailerProductHistory."

      #
      # Historiographer will automatically setup the association
      # to the primary class (e.g. RetailerProduct)
      #
      # If the History class has already defined this association, raise
      # an error, because we don't yet see any reason why end users
      # should be allowed to override this method.
      #
      # At some point, we may decide to allow this, but for now, we don't
      # know what the requirements/use cases would be.
      #
      # e.g.
      #
      # if RetailerProductHistory.respond_to?(:retailer_product)
      #   raise "RetailerProductHistory already has #retailer_product association. Talk to Brett if this is a legit use case"
      # else
      #   belongs_to :retailer_product, class_name: RetailerProduct
